## Hi, I'm Sam Virolainen  👋

🎓 Ph.D. in Immunology & Genetics | Scientist in Respiratory & Immunology @ AstraZeneca 

🔬 Specializing in Human Genetics, Multi-Omics Analysis, and Translational Immunology 

💻 Passionate about using large-scale genomic and genetic datasets to dissect immune pathway biology and inform patient biomarker strategy in drug development 


🧬 Research Interests

- Complex Immune-Mediated Diseases: Inflammatory (SLE, Sjögren's Syndrome, JIA, Systemic Sclerosis, IBD), Skin (Atopic Dermatitis), Respiratory (Asthma, COPD)
- Human Genetics Analyses (GWAS, Rare Variant Analysis, Colocalization, Mendelian Randomization) 
- Multi-Omics (Transcriptomic,Proteomic,Spatial) Analysis
- Translational Immunology: Pre-clinical in vitro, in vivo, and ex vivo models to characterize targetable immune pathways and identify clinical biomarkers
